# Level 10

## Description

This page contains a link to a sound file, called `Flag.wav`.

## Solution

This level is hard to write-up a response for, as it involves audio and not UNIX (or otherwise) sleuthing.

While initially listening to this file, it sounds like complete gibberish, but you can make out some patterns (it doesn't sound like static or some other machine noise).

Loading this file in an audio editor and slowing it down, renders the flag understandable from the person speaking.

In my case, I used the open source [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) tool, and slowed the sound file down by -80% (Effect -> Change Speed).

Once done, you can clearly hear someone say `infosec_flagis_sound` in the audio file when you play it back.

## Flag

`infosec_flagis_sound`
