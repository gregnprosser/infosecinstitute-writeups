      "The ciphertext from level 15 in the challenge appears a lot like a base64 encoded string, but doesn't decode using regular tools.  However, on a lark, I tried some rudimentary cryptanalysis on the ciphertext.  Cryptographers (people who break codes for a living) often use [crib](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Known-plaintext_attack) texts - information known about the result - to deduce information about the cryptography.\n",

      "To start with, it's worth discussing how base64 works.  base64 uses only alphabetic, numeric, and (generally) `+` and `/` characters to represent more complicated (i.e. binary) data.  The idea behind this is that these characters are usually transferred \"easier\" than complicated binary.\n",
      "\n",
      "A string is a collection of ASCII characters encoded as bytes.  During base64 encoding, this string of bytes is \"converted\" into a a string of 6-bit chunks instead, and each 6-bit chunk is encoded as one of the 64 characters in the acceptable set by indexing into an array containing `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/` (i.e. `A` represents `000000`)\n",
      "\n",
      "To experiment, lets start by assuming the first few characters of the result are the crib we know of, `infosec_flagis_`, and try to reverse the encoding to find a mapping table that would result in our string -- that is, if we assume the ciphertext represents that crib, what would the string we need to index into look like?"
